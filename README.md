#Matlab 2048 Game

A functional simulation of the popular online game 2048 within the Matlab IDE. My game creates a matrix of 4 by 4 and then it throws at any random location 2's and 4's. 
What the user needs to do is to add same numbers (that is 2 with 2, 4 with 4, etc...) until it reaches the number 2048 but we careful, any wrong movement could cause
the locations to be locked before you reach the winning number.  Good Luck and Enjoy!!  (This was my first major coding project that I made back in 2018 when I was just 
a beginner so please, don't be too harsh with it.)
